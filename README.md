#riks in maintaining coffe shop

Risks:
Obviously, there are problems in coffee shop maintenance, especially things related to data management. It is claimed that risks can be divided into three categories (Heldman, 2003, p. 148): 
# Known risks
#Known risks with unknown consequences
#Unknown risks
There are several problems that we have already identified, but from my perspective, our group with four newbies will definitely face difficulties when developing a coffee shop project because we have to decide which database software to use due to the fact that there are mix variety of those (such as MySQL, SQL developer, Couchbase, AmazoneRDS) and then starting to learn it due to the lack of experiences four new database system learners. However, we decided to use MySQL, a language, up to a point, complicated but easy to learn and practice as well as its wide availability of learning online websites. Next, despite of the fact that we have investigated thoroughly, some are not fully understood or properly measured. For example, we will need to maintain additional management programs just in a period of time to cope with the situation if our project expands extensively. The most threatening aspect is unknown risks since they are unpredictable, appear when nobody expects it such as the disappearance of members or the outdated of the chosen language. More may come up when we are working on business and most sufficient way to address them are calm down and solving step-by-step.
